### Deity

You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give your god a name and choose your deity’s domain: 

 [] Healing and Restoration
 [] Bloody Conquest
 [] Civilization
 [] Knowledge and Hidden Things
 [] The Downtrodden and Forgotten
 [] What Lies Beneath

Choose one precept of your religion: 

 [] It preaches the sanctity of suffering, add Petition: Suffering
 [] It’s clutish and insular, add Petition: Gaining Secrets
 [] It Observes important sacrificial rites, add Petition: Offering
 [] It believes in trial by combat, add Petition: Personal Victory

### Divine Guidance

When you **petition your deity according to the precept of your religion**, you are granted some useful knowledge or boon related to your deity’s domain. The GM will tell you what.

### Cast A Spell (WIS)

When you unleash a spell granted by your deity, roll+WIS. On a 10+ the the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again.  On a 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one: 

 * You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how. 
 * Your casting distances you from your deity; take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you commune.
 * After it is cast, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

### Commune

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in **quiet contemplation** with your deity, you:

 * Lose any spells already granted to you 
 * Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed your own level +1, and none of which is a higher level than your own level 
 * Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit

### Turn Undead

When you **hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection**, roll+Wis. 

 * On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you.
 * On a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal.
