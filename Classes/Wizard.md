## Starting Moves

### Cast A Spell (INT) 

When you **release a spell you’ve prepared**, roll+INT.

 * On a 10+ the the spell is successfully cast and you may cast the spell again later.
 * On a 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one:
  - You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
  - The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast; take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
  - After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell again until you prepare spells. 

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

### Prepare Spells

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in **quiet contemplation** of your spellbook, you:

 * Lose any spells you already prepared 
 * Prepare new spells chosen from your spellbook whose total levels don’t exceed your own level +1
 * Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit

# Spellbook

You have mastered several spells and inscribed them in your spellbook. You start out with three first level spells, as well as all your cantrips. Whenever you gain a level, you inscribe a new spell of your level or lower. Your spellbook is 1 weight.

# Spell Defense

You may end any ongoing spell immediately and use the energy of its dissipation to deflect an oncoming attack. The spell ends and you subtract its level from the damage done to you.

# Ritual

When you draw on a place of power to create a magical effect, tell the GM what you’re trying to achieve. Ritual effects are always possible, but the GM will give you one to four of the following conditions:

 * It’s going to take days/weeks/months
 * First you must ____ 
 * You’ll need help from ____ 
 * It will require a lot of money 
 * The best you can do is a lesser version, unreliable and limited
 * You and your allies will risk danger from ____ 
 * You’ll have to disenchant ____ to do it

## Advanced Moves (2 - 10)

### Prodigy

Choose a spell. You prepare that spell as if it were one level lower. 

### Empowered Magic 

When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may additionally choose one of the following effects: 

 * The spell’s effects are maximized
 * The spell’s targets are doubled

### Fount Of Knowledge

When you spout lore about something no one else has any clue about, take +1. 

### Know-It-All 

When another player’s character comes to you for advice and you tell them what you think is best, they get +1 forward when following your advice and you mark experience if they do. 

### Expanded Spellbook

Add a new spell from the spell list of any class to your spellbook. 

### Enchanter

When you have time and safety with a magic item you may ask the GM what it does. The GM will answer truthfully.

### Logical

When you use strict deduction to analyse your surroundings, you can Discern Realities with INT instead of WIS. 

### Arcane Ward 

As long as you have at least one prepared spell of first level or higher, you have +2 armor. 

### Counterspell

When you attempt to counter an arcane spell that will otherwise affect you, stake one of your prepared spells on the defense and roll+INT. On a 10+, the spell is countered and has no effect on you. On a 7-9, the spell is countered and you forget the spell that you staked. Your counterspell protects you alone; if the countered spell has other targets they are affected as normal. 

### Quick Study

When you see the effects of an arcane spell, ask the GM the name of the spell and its effects. You take +1 when acting on the answers.

## Advanced Moves (6 - 10)

 * The spell’s effects are maximized 
 * The spell’s targets are doubled

### Ethereal Tether

When you have time with a willing or helpless subject you can craft an ethereal tether with them. You perceive what they do and can discern realities about them or their surroundings, no matter the distance. Someone willingly tethered to you can communicate with you over the tether as if you were in the room with them. 

### Spell Augmentation

When you **deal damage to a creater**, you can shunt a spell’s energy into them—end one of your ongoing spells and add the spell’s level to the damage dealt.

### Self-Powered

When you have time, arcane materials, and a safe space, you can create your own place of power. Describe to the GM what kind of power it is and how you’re binding it to this place, the GM will tell you one kind of creature that will have an interest in this.
