## Starting Moves

### Arcane Art 

When you weave a performance into a basic spell, choose an ally and an effect:

 * Heal 1d8 damage
 * +1d4 forward to damage
 * Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment 
 * The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1 Then roll+CHA.
 * On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect. • On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.

### Charming & Open

When you speak frankly with someone, you can ask their player a question from the list below. They must answer it truthfully, then they may ask you a question from the list (which you must answer truthfully).

 * Whom do you serve?
 * What do you wish I would do?
 * How can I get you to _____?
 * What are you really feeling right now?
 * What do you most desire?

 * Spells and Magicks 
 * The Dead and Undead 
 * Grand Histories of the Known World

 * The Planar Spheres
 * Legends of Heroes
 * Past Gods and Their Servants

When you **first encounter an important creature, location, or item** (your call) covered by your bardic lore you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully. The GM may then ask you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.
